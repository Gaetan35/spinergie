# Spinergie coding-test

The task that I had to do for this project is described in `coding-test.md`.
You need to have node and npm installed to run the project

## Running the project

- Run `npm install`
- To run the main script : `npm start`
- To run the tests : `npm test`

The input files are placed in the `inputFiles` folder, and the output will be placed in the `outputFiles` folder. The filenames used are in the `main.js` script.

## My interpretation

I was not sure in what format the inputFile describing the wanted modifications was supposed to be.It did not seem to be valid json as it was not an array and not an object. So I chose to use a .txt file with the syntax used in the task description.

## Transformation failed

If a transformation fail because of an invalid path, something will be logged in the console. Otherwise if nothing is logged, the transformation was successful
